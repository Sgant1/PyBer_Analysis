# PyBer_Analysis
# Analysis Overview
It is our second week at the company PyBer a Python based ride sharing app company and the CEO of the company V. Isualize along with Omar my direct supervisor has asked to review the performance of particular cities along with the three different city types we are going to be working with.

The Key items we are Indexing are:
- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare per Ride
- Average fare per Driver

The City Type categories are:
- Rural
- Suburban
- Urban

We are accomplishing this through Jupyter while recording through png files the data we want to show Omar and V. Isualize.

# Results

Total Rides: 2,375

Total Drivers: 2,973

Total Fares: $63,358

Average Fare Per Ride: Rural - $34.62  Surburban - $30.97  Urban - $24.53  The average fare per ride is much higher in Rural vs. Urban at almost $10 more per ride.

Average Fare per Driver: Rural - $55.49  Surburban - $39.50  Urban - $16.57

Total Fare By City: The total fares by city type ranges significantly in favor of Urban rides. Surburban comes in second, with Rural taking in the least amount. Keeping in mind that this data is strictly from Jan - Apr 2019, we can determine that Urban rides are significantly higher in total fares by city type.

# Summary

The recommendations as requested by CEO V. Isualize are:

1. We should increase drivers in Rural and Suburban areas.
  - There is significant Average Fare Per Ride revenue incentives that would increase total revenue for the company per ride.
  - If we are increasing the number of drivers and our average revenue is going up for this region, we can likely offer higher salaries to the drivers working this region since our average fare morie than doubles from Urban to Surburban city types.

2. Increase average fare per ride in Urban areas:
- The Total Rides for this region double Surburban areas and are almost 15x more frequent than Rural areas. Given the demand for this region, the average fare per ride can increase total revenue for the company.

3. Give driver initiatives to transfer from Urban to Rural or Suburban areas:
- Rural areas have a total 125 Rides requested with only 78 drivers able to fill the demand.
- Suburban areas have 625 rides requested with 490 drivers to fill the demand.
- By transferring drivers from Urban to Rural or Suburban areas it will help meet the ride to driver demand while hopefully giving more frequent work to the overall driver pool since Urban areas have more drivers than rides being requested.
